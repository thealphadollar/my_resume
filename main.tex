% \fontsize{9}{12}\selectfont{
\begin{description}[style=nextline, font=$\bullet$\hspace{2mm}\normalsize]
 \item[Learning to extract comparison points of entity pairs from Wikipedia articles] Worked on a novel comparative text mining task using relational tuples to model and measure semantic commonality for two given documents and tabulating them. This work was published as a poster at JCDL 2018.
 \item[Compiler for Tiny C (A tiny subset of the C language)] Built a compiler for Tiny C, a self-defined subset of the C language, using Compiler principles and techniques. The compiler itself was written in C++ with Flex and Bison for Lexical Analysis and Semantic parsing.
 \item[Mini Linux Shell] Implemented some features of the Linux Shell including redirection, piping and terminal mirroring using the C language.
 \item[Lyrics generator using neural networks] Wrote a lyrics generator using TensorFlow that generates a new song in an artist's style. A Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network learns the artists' styles of writing including words, rhymes, chorus patterns, etc. for the task.
%  \item[Data extraction from biomedical literature for automating systematic reviews] Worked on feature detection of a particular class of text (specifically, inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients) from a huge collection of biomedical literature using NLP Techniques with high precision and recall.
 \item[Selene] Built a social music-recommendation Android app that analyzes songs liked by a users' friends on YouTube and recommends them to the user as a trending feed with added song metadata using the MusixMatch API.
 \item[Retrieving salient sentences from Reddit AMAs] Built a summariser for /r/IAmA to create reader-friendly digests that are clustered by topic and presented to the user.
 \item[Graph Extractor] Built a graph extractor that uses image processing techniques to detect multivariate graphs in any given PDF and tabulates them autonomously, taking into consideration features like axis values, scales and legends.
 \item[MetaKGP dashboard] Currently working with student developers on a NUS-Mods style dashboard for IIT KGP with several utilities for the community like smart timetable, news aggregator, question paper portal and professor finder to name a few.
% \item[Studious] Built a complete course management system that supported authentication \& authorization, User Access Control for 4 different types of users, real-time messaging with notifications (using socket.io), calendar support, etc.
%  \item[Medical Lab Automation System] Developed software using JAVA Swing for a Medical Lab Automation System which handles and automates all requests of the management and patients.
